Invoice 1 was one of the first WOD's where we had to use dynamic variables and outputs which is found here [Invoice1](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html). Another thing to know is that this essay is based upon questions which are written but can be found through [E3: Preparing for WODs Essay](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html)
## Experience of Invoice 1
Through experience I felt like I did pretty well following the steps. I had a good grasp on understanding what to do. I think the only time I would fumble is when I actually forgot how to write a command. Other than that it was a pretty smooth experience as long as I have a table that I can just copy and paste from. Oh, and the code that I fumbled was actually me missing a $ sign infront of price.

## Describe what you to did to prepare. What did you do similarly or differently from the WOD before this?
To prepare, I went over what we learned in class, and after trying for myself I went to the screencast. Honestly the screencast just helped bandage the mistakes that I made and was overall the more useful tool that I can rely on. Similarily to last WOD I based off how I tackled the task similarly to how the professor taught it. Differently, well I tried to implement more of what I learned in class but I felt like it was easier to go along with the WOD since I seem to understand it more when I can slow down the video.

## Discuss what you could have done to be better prepared and what you might try differently for the next WOD.
Honestly, to better prepare for these WOD’s I think it would be more effective to study the supplementary reading that is posted, and to go over the videos that is given before the lesson. It’s not like I don’t watch and read them but I should pay more attention. I belive this would strengthen my core of my practice which would in the end make my screencast watching experience better.
