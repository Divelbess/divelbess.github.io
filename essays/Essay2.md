## How I felt about Browser History 1

I personally believed that this was one of the easier WODs. I was not really stuck at all. When I did it the first time I really only stumbled on rememebering how to put my picture in and at what size. The rest of it I kind've just remembered from my old IT class. I personally just needed to watch the demonstration one time only for just a refresher on some tags that slipped my mind.

## How I felt about Browser History 2

Man this took me hours, and it wasn't even the content that had me in a bind. It was the fact that I did not force refresh my page. I was just mindlessly fixing my code even though it wasn't even my code that was the issue. My css page just wasn't loading but it was running through the old cache. My work that I had made progress on wasn't loading and therefore I thought it was me just inputting my code wrong. I would've saved hours if I just googled and understood the whole cache and force reload mechanic.

## How I Felt about Browser History 3

Browser History 3 felt like Browser History 2 in a way where I was just building upon my first index in Browser History 1. I had troubles with remembering tags and aligning my page. For some reasons my mind just couldn't remember the tags until later tries down the line. I don't know why I couldn't remember them but they just couldn't stick. Other than that I believe that my Google paragraphs are maybe wrong? I don't know why they aren't going down in a column but in a way it looks correct to me. It isn't exactly like the photo but I mean it is really close. If I get feedback on why my google paragraphs are indented weirdly I am always ready to fix it.
