## How I felt about Browser History 1

I personally believed that this was one of the easier WODs. I was not really stuck at all. When I did it the first time I really only stumbled on rememebering how to put my picture in and at what size. The rest of it I kind've just remembered from my old IT class. I personally just needed to watch the demonstration one time only for just a refresher on some tags that slipped my mind.

## How I felt about Browser History 2

Man this took me hours, and it wasn't even the content that had me in a bind. It was the fact that I did not force refresh my page. I was just mindlessly fixing my code even though it wasn't even my code that was the issue. My css page just wasn't loading but it was running through the old cache. My work that I had made progress on wasn't loading and therefore I thought it was me just inputting my code wrong. I would've saved hours if I just googled and understood the whole cache and force reload mechanic.

## How I Felt about Browser History 3

Browser History 3 felt like Browser History 2 in a way where I was just building upon my first index in Browser History 1. I had troubles with remembering tags and aligning my page. For some reasons my mind just couldn't remember the tags until later tries down the line. I don't know why I couldn't remember them but they just couldn't stick. Other than that I believe that my Google paragraphs are maybe wrong? I don't know why they aren't going down in a column but in a way it looks correct to me. It isn't exactly like the photo but I mean it is really close. If I get feedback on why my google paragraphs are indented weirdly I am always ready to fix it.

## Brief Intro about Invoice 1

Invoice 1 was about having a interative table that changes as you put numbers into the variables. There were 5 variables in which we inputted data such as price, name, and quantity. After the data was implemented I did calculations that were implemented into the code such as var extended_price, or var tax =. All of which the end goal was a interactive website.

## Experience of Invoice 1

Through experience I felt like I did pretty well following the steps. I had a good grasp on understanding what to do. I think the only time I would fumble is when I actually forgot how to write a command. Other than that it was a pretty smooth experience as long as I have a table that I can just copy and paste from. Oh, and the code that I fumbled was actually me missing a $ sign infront of price.

## Describe what you to did to prepare. What did you do similarly or differently from the WOD before this?

To prepare, I went over what we learned in class, and after trying for myself I went to the screencast. Honestly the screencast just helped bandage the mistakes that I made and was overall the more useful tool that I can rely on. Similarily to last WOD I based off how I tackled the task similarly to how the professor taught it. Differently, well I tried to implement more of what I learned in class but I felt like it was easier to go along with the WOD since I seem to understand it more when I can slow down the video.

## Discuss what you could have done to be better prepared and what you might try differently for the next WOD.

Honestly, to better prepare for these WOD's I think it would be more effective to study the supplementary reading that is posted, and to go over the videos that is given before the lesson. It's not like I don't watch and read them but I should pay more attention. I belive this would strengthen my core of my practice which would in the end make my screencast watching experience better.
