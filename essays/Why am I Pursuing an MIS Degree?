## How did I get here?

As a senior in highschool I came to UH at Manoa to tour and see what I may or may not want to be. I attended a couple meetings and the first place I ended up was reviewing the health majors. The conversations that I had just made me discouraged because I believed that I would not make it. Individuals that spoke to me seemed to come across as slightly degrading since apparently they have not accepted someone like me with a certain GPA. Overall, my spirits were down and I felt like it just was not my calling. Therefore, I tried to aim for my strengths and since I love the internet, management, money, numbers, and just the overall usage of technology. I decided to go scout out the business majors. The right area that fitted this criteria for me was MIS, therefore I talked to my parents and we all had an agreement that this is the major that I will aim for.

## Why am I taking this class?

I am taking this class since I believe the skills that I will obtain will be useful in my career. It was also recommended to me by star campus, and I agree that I might as well learn more about technology as a whole. All together, it just seemed to line up with the pathway that I want to follow. It gives me the opportunity to learn skills that I have no clue how to do and it fufills the requirements that I need to continue down the path that I want to venture. I also looked up the professor and I thought I could probably learn something if I tried hard enough.

## Who influenced me?

Stated above, in the beginning, I mentioned that I talked with my parents about what major I wanted to walk towards. They did some research to help me and they said this could be a stable career for me. My parents were always supportive of me and understood what my limits could be. Therefore when they agreed that this is it, I jumped to the opportunity and here I am. Individuals that also changed my mind away from health to MIS is my friends and the instructors that said that health probably was not for me. My friends were trying their best to state that I should not over exert myself for a dream that is nearly impossible, and the people in the health field that talked to me seemed to agree. I felt like I was not needed there and even though I felt slightly disheartened I believed that I could bring my expertise somewhere else. In conclusion, my final decisions for being here came from my family, friends, instructors, and of course my own thought process behind it.
